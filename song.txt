Courage!, Duty!, Honor!
We call upon our troopers in this our darkest hour.
Our way of life is what we are fighting for.
The flag that flies above us, inspires us each day.
To give our very best, in every way!

It's a good day to die,
When you know the reasons why.
Citizens we fight for what is right,
A noble sacrifice.
When duty calls, you pay the price
For the federation I will give my life.
